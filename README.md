-   the application is pretty much automated, but there is no history, so it will only register cases from when it was openend in the browser.
-   case number:
    -   green: xbox
    -   blue: playstation
    -   orange: PC
-   system name red: system is not confirmed (will go white if sysconf detected)
-   language will be white if english, red otherwise
-   client name will go red and underlined if they are disconnected
-   case background will be green if there is a new message
-   **in case something goes wrong with a case, clicking on the case number will remove the case from the dashboard**
